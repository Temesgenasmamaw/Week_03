### Business Objective:

AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS), a leader in car insurance planning and marketing in South Africa, aims to leverage advanced risk and predictive analytics to enhance its strategies. As a new marketing analytics engineer, your role is to analyze historical insurance claims data to optimize marketing strategies and identify "low-risk" customer segments that may qualify for reduced premiums, potentially attracting new clients.

To achieve this goal, you will focus on key areas including:

### Insurance Terminology:
Familiarize yourself with essential insurance terms by reviewing key resources like 50 Common Insurance Terms and What They Mean from Cornerstone Insurance Brokers.

### A/B Hypothesis Testing:
Use A/B testing to assess various hypotheses, such as:

Are there risk differences across provinces or between zip codes?
Are there significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes?
Are there notable risk differences between men and women?
Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling:
Build models to:

Predict total claims using a linear regression model for each zip code.
Develop machine learning models to forecast optimal premium values based on features such as car details, owner attributes, and location.
Analyze the important features influencing your model and report on their predictive power.
The final report should outline your methodologies, present the findings, and offer recommendations for improving or enhancing insurance products based on test results, helping ACIS to better align with consumer needs.

### Motivation:
This project will enhance your skills in Data Engineering, Predictive Analytics, and Machine Learning, while simulating the challenges and deadlines typical in financial analytics. Engaging with these tasks will sharpen your ability to handle complex datasets, adapt to challenges, and think creatively in the insurance domain.
